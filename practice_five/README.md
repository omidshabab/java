# Student GPA Tracker

This program allows you to track the GPAs of multiple students and find the student with the highest and lowest GPA.

## Problem Description

Write a program that accepts the following information for multiple students as input: student name, student ID, number of grades, and the grades themselves. The program should perform the following tasks:

- Find the student with the highest GPA and display their information on the screen.
- Find the student with the lowest GPA and display their information on the screen.

## Solution

The solution to the problem involves the following steps:

1. Prompt the user to enter the number of students.
2. Create arrays to store the student information (names, student IDs, and grades).
3. Use a loop to collect the name, student ID, and grades for each student.
4. Calculate the GPA for each student.
5. Find the student with the highest GPA and the student with the lowest GPA using separate loops.
6. Display the information of the student with the highest GPA and the student with the lowest GPA.

The provided Java code implements the solution to the problem. The code prompts the user to enter the number of students and then collects the necessary information for each student. It calculates the GPA for each student and finds the student with the highest and lowest GPA. Finally, it displays the information of the student with the highest GPA and the student with the lowest GPA.

To run the program, compile the Java file and execute the resulting class file.

```shell
javac Main.java
java Main
```

## Usage

1. Enter the number of students when prompted.
2. For each student, enter their name, student ID, and the number of grades.
3. Enter the grades for each student.
4. The program will display the information of the student with the highest GPA and the student with the lowest GPA.

Please note that the program assumes valid input for simplicity. Ensure that you provide the correct number of grades when prompted.

Feel free to modify the program or extend it to suit your specific requirements.
