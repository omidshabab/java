# Rectangle Class

This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates the use of a `Rectangle` class. The program allows the user to input the width and length of a rectangle and calculates its perimeter and area.

## Problem

The problem addressed by this program is the need to calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle given its width and length. 

## Solution

The solution is implemented using a `Rectangle` class that encapsulates the width and length of the rectangle and provides methods to set the dimensions, calculate the perimeter, and calculate the area.

The program follows the standard structure for a Java application and consists of the following files:

- `Main.java`: Contains the `Main` class with the `main` method to execute the program.
- `Rectangle.java`: Defines the `Rectangle` class with methods to set the dimensions, calculate the perimeter, and calculate the area.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code files.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Compile and run the `Main` class.
4. Enter the width and length of the rectangle when prompted.
5. The program will calculate and display the perimeter and area of the rectangle.

```java
Enter a width:
[Enter the width of the rectangle]
Enter a length:
[Enter the length of the rectangle]
[Perimeter of the rectangle]
[Area of the rectangle]
```
