# Practice Two

This is a Java program that calculates the value of a mathematical expression based on user input.

## Problem

The program aims to calculate the value of the expression `1 / (x^2 + x + 3)`, where `x` is a user-defined floating-point number.

## Solution

The solution involves the following steps:

1. Read the user input for the value of `x`.
2. Pass the input value to the `calculate` function.
3. Calculate the value of `_calculateX` using the formula `1 / (x^2 + x + 3)`.
4. Return the calculated value `_calculateX`.
5. Print the result.

## Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Java file using the Java compiler: `javac Main.java`.
2. Run the compiled program: `java Main`.

## Example

Here's an example of running the program:

```
Enter the value of x: 2.5
The calculated value is: 0.053097344
```

In this case, the user has entered `2.5` as the value of `x`, and the program has calculated the corresponding result as `0.053097344`.

## Note

- The input value `x` should be a floating-point number.
- The program uses the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package to read user input.
- The program assumes that the input will be valid and does not perform any input validation or error handling.
- Division by zero is not handled, so make sure not to provide a value of `x` that would result in division by zero.
